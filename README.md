# Getting Data Task

• This project is a small application consisting of building an API using ASP.NET Core 6 API and another project to display the data on an HTML page. The API retrieves data from a database using Entity Framework, transforms the data into a graph structure, and then displays the data as required using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

• The data is stored in a single table with three columns, as illustrated in the following image.

• The data in the database is represented in the form of a complete binary tree, and the goal is to display the data as shown.

• We utilized the graph as a data structure and performed a DFS traversal on the data to display it as required.

• Furthermore, we developed an HTML page that uses JavaScript, specifically leveraging the AJAX library, to display the data in a table.
